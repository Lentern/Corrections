# Corrections/Additional Information for Lentern Videos
This includes more information and corrections that people may need to know about my videos. YouTube removed annotations a long time ago and there's sadly  no other proper way for me to do this.

Have a correction? Tell me in an [issue](https://github.com/Lentern/Corrections/issues) or leave a comment on the video.

## The Fallout of the Minecraft Chat Report System ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnAt-bOY1_8))
* It should be noted that **this video is sort of a reupload.** The original video did not contain the amount of information I was looking for and there were some parts I wanted to change. More information is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxSdi6waQMUD10uN04ajVLNJJzz4CZH84F) and the original video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twnj0t-neqo).
* The text at [14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnAt-bOY1_8&t=862s) should say "Disabling Chat Reporting", I just messed up a text attribute in the editing.

## The COMPLETE History of Minecraft's Far Lands (2009-2022) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA))
* At [8:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=488s), "The reason why the Far Lands appear different in the earlier Infdev build was because the interval between sampling points on the Y axis was most likely 4 blocks like on the X and Z axes, and it was only changed to 8 blocks on the Y axis later in Infdev. Noise is only calculated at sampling points and interpolated in between using a quintic equation whose overflowing at the floating-point limit results in another set of Far Lands far beyond 2^63, which I refer to as the Fringe Lands." (thanks, [Allam A.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4B9cOO6KxTDVnnbvRbDJGw) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=Ugz83mbqQ9myVhaOWmx4AaABAg)))
* At [10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=618s), "The Far Lands can generate smooth at their initiation if one of the noise generators has an offset that pushes the value at 12550824 just slightly over 2^31, and it is a rather nice effect." (thanks, [Allam A.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4B9cOO6KxTDVnnbvRbDJGw) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=Ugz83mbqQ9myVhaOWmx4AaABAg)))
* At [11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=686s), "It can actually be seen when teleporting in the negative direction on only one axis (i. e. -25101648 150 1 or 1 150 -25101648) in the form of minor changes in the artifacts of the Edge Far Lands." (thanks, [Allam A.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4B9cOO6KxTDVnnbvRbDJGw) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=Ugz83mbqQ9myVhaOWmx4AaABAg)))
* I failed to clarify that the stuttering bug was caused by a glitch in the game's rendering engine. I was a little bit to vague when I said "it was a visual glitch." (thanks, [Sam Holland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDAlBb_gXZKOilekvtGjBWg) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&lc=UgzzKxnBXXG3cvBIubt4AaABAg)))
* At [5:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=327s), I made a mistake saying that terrain past 32 million was not solid. In this version, it was 16777216 instead because the limit was unintentional. Any boundaries at a clean number like 30 million or 32 million are manually added. The limits at powers of two are typically bugs. I also mentioned this at [5:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExqfNJivDYA&t=301s).

## Beating the Hardest Version of Minecraft (PART 1) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy1t-AnpFGY))
* This is the first video where I began rendering my videos in 1440p. YouTubs allocates more data (higher bitrates) to higher quality videos so they will look better on YouTube. Watch in that quality if your bandwidth approves.

## Beating Minecraft Hardcore Mode with Only Stone Tools (PART 2) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJpjw3mq_SI))
* There was a weird black screen at [9:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJpjw3mq_SI&t=581s) that slipped into the render. This is an error, you can ignore it.

## Beating Minecraft Hardcore Mode with Only Stone Tools (PART 1) ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ner8qSl9-jE))
* The microphone audio and the game audio are desynced slightly in this video because I recorded my microphone audio with a separate program. I didn't line up the audio properly and this is my fault.
